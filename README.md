On this site, Carly created the Choropleth graph using javascript. She also used Python to webscrape several websites and populate the Total Covid Cases/Deaths windows on the webpage. Carly also obtained and cleaned covid data from the New York Times and The Atlantic to prepare the data to be usable in various visualizations. Finally she created a flask app to allow the site to pull information from our Mongo Database.
